I'm Tapas Datta, a Senior Software Engineer rooted in the vibrant city of Dhaka. My days are immersed in the dynamic world of technology, specializing in the elegant languages of Erlang & Elixir. I pursued both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Passion for Software Architecture and AI runs deep in my veins.
